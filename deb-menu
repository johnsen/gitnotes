[14:53] <arand> flower: If you just run dh-make in the package directory you will get one
[14:54] <flower> arand: ok, but there is no package yet, only the files
[14:55] <arand> So you have a directory full of these files you want to install?
[14:56] <flower> yes, some menu related files, one should go into /usr/share/applications the other in /etc/xdg/menus etc
[14:56] <arand> rename that directory to packagename-3.5.6 (e.g.) and run dh-make inside it to get started.

[14:57] <arand> s/dh-make/dh_make/
[14:59] <arand> And if you do not have a tarball from the original source  you may want to use --createorig otherwise, rename it as per packagename_up.stream.version.orig.tar.gz
[15:00] <arand> flower: E.g. packagename_3.5.6.orig.tar.gz
[15:00] <flower> arand: ok
[15:04] <flower> hmm ok that's a start
